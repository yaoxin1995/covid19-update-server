# COVID-19 Update Service

The aim of the COVID-19 Update Service is to inform a user about the current COVID-19 7-day incidence for, by the user selected, locations within Germany. Therefore the user should be able to select multiple locations, that are then monitored by the service. For each location the user should be able to set a threshold for the incidence value. Whenever the COVID-19 7-day incidence value for a region exceeds the threshold, the user should be notified. Besides from providing the notifications through the service's API, the notifications should be also shipped via email and/or Telegram.
